calRec: converts physical position (GRCh37, hg19) to genetic position

Introduction:
	The GRCh37 genetic map (e.g., genetic_map_GRCh37_chr*.txt) was generated by lifting the
	HapMap Phase II genetic map from build 35 to GRCh37. The original map was generated using
	LDhat as described in the 2007 HapMap paper (Nature, 18th Sept 2007). The conversion from
	b35 to GRCh37 was achieved using the UCSC liftOver tool.
	
	chr23: chrX without pseudoautosomal regions
	chr24: pseudoautosomal region Part 1 in chrX
	chr25: pseudoautosomal region Part 2 in chrX

Compile: 
	g++ calRec.cpp -o calRec

Usage:
	1. Make sure the exeutable file ./calRec and genetic maps file in the same directory
	2. Convert physical position (GRCh37, hg19) to genetic position by
		./calRec -i <input file> -l <number of markers> -c <No. chromosome> -o <output file>

Options:
	-h, --help:	print this help and exit
	-i, --input:	name for the input file (e.g. example.info); a list of physical
			position (GRCh37, hg19) for markers; separate files for each chromosome.
			(see an example in ./GeneticMap)
	-l, --numMarker:the number of markers in the input file
	-c, --chr:	the chromosome name
	-o, --out:	name for the output file. This file has two columns. The first
			column lists the physical position. The second column lists the
			converted genetic position
			
Examples (the working directory ./GeneticMap):
$ ./calRec -i example.txt -l 17 -c 19 -o result.txt
